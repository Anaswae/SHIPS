version 1.1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixes and issue that caused session timeouts to use IdentSQLite even when it was not the default Ident. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Made a 1 byte change to SHIPS.  There is a typo that can result in a 1E or 1F character in passwords, apparently windows machines don't have a glyph to display it and in any case would be a challenge if someone is typing rather than copy/pasting the password values.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* added linux support on the client scripts
* added additional sanitization through ldap queries (shouldn't matter, just extra precaution measures)
* updated documentation to reflect new Linux client scripts

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* switched to securerandom instead of random for password generation

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* initial release of ships
